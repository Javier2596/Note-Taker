# Note Taker 

## Description

This application was desinged to write and save notes. The focus point of this project was to create the back end of the application and connect it to the front end and deploy it to Heroku. By completing this application I was provided with the challenge to test my skills with Express.js and using functions involving GET and POST routes. I built this project to better my knowledge of back end web development. The problems that were fixed were connecting the front end starter code with back end code to retrieve data from the user and render it to the note page.

## Installation

The deployment for this project is through Heroku. First an npm i and npm start must be ran in the terminal. Then the terminal will prompt a link to the deployed site through heroku. From there the webpage will provide a link to be taken to the notes page where the user can write and save notes.

## Usage

To use this application, first the user will need to perform an "npm i" installation in the vs terminal. After the user will have to perform "npm start". After that, by following the link in the terminal the user will be taken to the homepage which has a link that takes the user to the note page where they can write notes and save them with the save icon. The notes will save in a json file and rendered back on the left hand side of the same page. There is a plus symbol on the top right hand side of the notes page that allows the user to make new notes. If the user clicks on any of the previous saved notes they will appear on the right side of the notes page in bigger text.
